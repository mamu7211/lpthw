# prints concatenated word 'Cheese', preventing a newline
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6,
# then prints concatenated word 'Burger', both are separated by space because of the comma...
print end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12
# watch that comma at the end. try removing to see what happens...
# ...essentially it prevents the linebreak and adds a space between the two concatenated strings
